Now we can journey many places of the world by air within a very short time. It is the quickest means of travel the science and technology have ever produced.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The occasion of my journey:<\/strong>\u00a0I had a desire for a journey by air for long. At last the chance to fulfil my desire came to me when one of my maternal aunts living at Jessore asked me to see her at her house. She also sent me a ticket of Bangladesh Biman. As my School was closed for the S.S.C. Examination. I was very glad and thrilled at this offer of travelling by aeroplane. The journey was from Dhaka to\u00a0Jessore.<\/p>\n<p><strong>At the airport:<\/strong>\u00a0As my flight was at 8.30 a.m. I reached the Dhaka airport at about 8 a.m. After the necessary formalities performed by the air officials, I boarded the plane at 8. 15 a.m.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Taking off:<\/strong>\u00a0Right at 8.30 a.m., the plane began to move. First, it ran slowly and gradually developing its speed, took off from the runway.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Description of the journey:<\/strong>\u00a0Our plane rose up at a legit of nine. hundred feet. It was flying very smoothly. I looked down through the window beside me. I became bewildered to see the land below. It appeared so little that it seemed to be a garden. Human beings appeared little like so many small ants and the houses like little matchboxes. The boats in the river and the motor vehicles on the streets seemed to be moving puppets. The rivers and canals below looked like zig-zag lanes. Soon I was lost in thought of the great power of the modern science. Just then an air hostess came and offered me snacks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction:\u00a0There was a time when a man would become a wonder to see birds fly in thy sky.
