Are you fairly confident that you know what the rest of the article is about? If so, you have likely read the topic sentence. An effective topic sentence combines a main idea with the writer\u2019s personal attitude or opinion. It serves to orient the reader and provides an indication of what will follow in the rest of the paragraph. Read the following example.<\/p>\n<p>This topic sentence declares a favorable position for standardizing math and English education. After reading this sentence, a reader might reasonably expect the writer to provide supporting details and facts as to why standardizing math and English education might improve student learning in many states. If the purpose of the essay is actually to evaluate education in only one particular state, or to discuss math or English education specifically, then the topic sentence is misleading.<\/p>\n<p>Topic sentences contain both a\u00a0<span class=\"im_margin_term\"><span class=\"im_glossterm\">main idea<\/span><\/span>\u00a0(the subject, or topic that the writer is discussing) and a\u00a0<span class=\"im_margin_term\"><span class=\"im_glossterm\">controlling idea<\/span><\/span>\u00a0(the writer\u2019s specific stance on that subject). Just as a thesis statement includes an idea that controls a document\u2019s focus (as you will read about in Chapter 7 \u201cThe Writing Process: How Do I Begin?\u201d), a topic sentence must also contain a controlling idea to direct the paragraph. Different writers may use the same main idea but can steer their paragraph in a number of different directions according to their stance on the subject.
